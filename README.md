#Facebook External Link Blocker

This Chrome plugin aims to block annoying external links that people post on Facebook.
Currently it simply hides the offending div's so they are still in the source if
you really need to see them. Only the offending links, images, and captions are
removed. Their posters and comments are left in place.

##TODO

* Add to Chrome Plugin Repository (eventually)
* Add icon
* Use better event to hook on than scrolling
* Use better property to pick links
* Test for other types of links to block
* Whitelisting of sites
* Enable/Disable with url bar icon
* Add permissive license
